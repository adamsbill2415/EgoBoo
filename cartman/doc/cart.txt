Right now (6/01), the SDL port of cartman is still incomplete, so
you have to use the old dos version. You have to start it up in the
egoboo\cartman directory and give it the name of the module to edit.
You can only run it from dos.

>From programmer X:

Generic keys
  Esc           = Quit
  F1            = Quit ( in case your Esc key is broken... )
  W             = Write the file ( Save )

Functions
  5             = Adjust the height of selected vertices ( deep pit level )
  6             = Adjust the height of selected vertices ( shallow pit level )
  7             = Adjust the height of selected vertices ( raised platform level )
  X             = Good key.  Put borders around tiles that the cursor is over
  G             = Good key.  Welds corner vertices together so there aren`t holes
  J             = Jitter all the vertices or selected vertices, good for outdoors ( J G )
  Space         = Weld selected vertices together
  F             = Fixes corner vertices for the tile the cursor is over
  Q             = Mystery key
  L + SHIFT     = Bad key.  Levels the walls...
  C + SHIFT     = Bad key.  Clears the map.  Can use at start to set basic terrain

Movement
  Cursors     = Scroll around
  M           = Move camera
  Middle Drag = Move camera ( Use M key for a 2 button mouse )

Brush Commands
  1             = Remove random the texture pattern
  2             = Set up a 2 tile random texture pattern
  3             = Set up a 4 tile random texture pattern
  4             = Set up a hi-res random texture pattern

  R             = Toggle the Reflection tile effect 
  D             = Toggle the Draw reflect tile effect 
  A             = Toggle the Animated tile effect 
  B             = Toggle the Barrier tile effect 
  I             = Toggle the Impassable tile effect 
  S             = Toggle the Slippy tile effect 
  H             = Toggle the Hurt tile effect 
  O             = Toggle the Overlay ( water ) tile effect 

  Ins           = Change brush mesh type
  Del           = Change brush mesh type

  Keypad +      = Change the brush texture
  Keypad -      = Change the brush texture

  Keypad 1      = Set brush size 1
  Keypad 3      = Set brush size 2
  Keypad 7      = Set brush size 3
  Keypad 9      = Set brush size 4

FX Window (bottom right)
  Left Click    = Set tile effects  
  Right Click   = Pick tile effects
  LShift (Hold) = Copy the tile effect to all similar tiles

Tile Window (top right)
  Left Click   = Drop tile ( Holding V or T is useful )
  Right Click  = Pick tile 
  K (Hold)     = Create a light ( do last, goes away if you quit )
  T (Hold)     = Good key.  No tile effect or vertex update
  V (Hold)     = Puts new tiles at floor level
  Z (Hold)     = Set tile type to the current brush type

Top Vertex Window (top left)
  Left Click   = Select vertices ( Holding CTRL or ALT is useful )
  Right Click  = Make a hill ( Use keypad 1, 3, 7, 9 )
  P            = Make a hill

Side Vertex Window (bottom left)
  Left Click   = Select vertices
  Right Click  = Move selected vertices
  U (Hold)     = Move tiles of selected type up and down
  Y (Hold)     = Move selected vertices up and down
  N (Hold)     = Move entire mesh up and down 
  E (Hold)     = Ease everything up and down


Notes...
  Red triangle mesh means hi-res 64x64 bitmap, blue means lo-res 32x32 bitmap
  Use barriers for corner walls so arrows don`t get stopped
  Same for iron gates
  Setup animated tiles in wawalite.txt
  Look at advent.mod to see how to do reflections
  Slippy tiles are for steep cliffs and raised platforms
  Use the two-triangle tiles as much as possible
  The rightmost slider lets you set how fast the hills grow or shrink
  To make a level...
    Press C to clear the map to the basic type ( use 3F for wall tops?  3E? )
    Draw the map, using 1 wall and 4 random floor tile types.  Map is ugly.
    Make sure triangle mesh is correct.  Diagonals point out on corners.
    Use X over the different tile types.  Map is pretty.
  To make walls...
    Use L to make everything flat
    Use N to move everything up in the bottom left window
    Select the floor tile by right clicking in the top right window
    Use U to move the floor down in the bottom left window.  Press G.
    Use U. Press G.
    Use U. Press G.
    Use U. Press G.
    Use U. Press G.
