This directory contains an object viewer for Egoboo.

It requires Qt 5.2.

This is based on [EOV](https://github.com/mohiji/eov).

## Building

Open the .pro file with Qt Creator or use qmake.

```
qmake EOV-qt.pro
make
```

## Using

To open an Egoboo game object, launch EOV-qt and select Open from
the File menu.

Once opened, you can drag the model around to view it from a 
different angle.

To see animations, simply select any number of frames from the frame
list window.
